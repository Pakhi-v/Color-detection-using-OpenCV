# Algorithm used

KMeans algorithm creates clusters based on the supplied count of clusters.

# About the Project

In this project, we have made a basic Object Detector by color using OpenCV python. Here we implemented the Color detection and Segmentation Technique. 

OpenCV is an open-source computer vision library. OpenCV is used in many real-time applications also. OpenCV has some built-in functions to perform Color detection and Segmentation operations.
